# 👋 Hi, I’m @NoSleepBTW

### **About Me**
I’m a professional **Data Analyst** who spends my days working with **Python**, **SQL**, and **Power BI** to turn complex data into something useful. Lately, I’ve been diving into the world of systems engineering and low-level programming because I want to understand how computers actually work from the ground up. I’m definitely not an expert yet—I’m very much in the "learning by breaking things" phase and staying humble as I figure it out.

### 🚀 **Current Project: Mission Control**
My main focus is building **Mission Control**, a custom, independent management system for my **Arch Linux** and **Hyprland** setup.
* **Goal:** Create a seamless, "Mac-like" experience by writing my own integration scripts instead of relying on heavy external frameworks.
* **Status:** The project is currently **60% complete**.
* **Progress:** Core configuration, wallpaper management, and color extraction systems are fully operational.
* **Independence:** Moving away from frameworks like HyDE to save space and learn exactly how my system components talk to each other.

### 🛠️ **Learning & Tinkering**
I am pushing myself to learn how to work with minimal resources and lower-level code:
* **C++ Foundations:** Currently working through the *C++ Primer* to learn programming fundamentals.
* **The "Pi" Way:** I do my learning on a **Raspberry Pi 5** using only **Neovim** to force myself to stay focused and efficient.
* **Home Lab:** I also run a home NAS on a Raspberry Pi for services like **Pi-hole**, **Unbound**, and **Docker**.

### 🕹️ **Off-Duty**
When I’m not debugging a volume script or learning pointers, you can usually find me:
* Running a campaign in **Baldur's Gate 3**.
* Winning the citizens over in **Metaphor: ReFantazio**.
* Tweaking my **Arch Linux** setup for that perfect macOS-inspired look.

### 🤝 **Let’s Connect**
I’m always looking to chat with fellow data folks, people also struggling through their first C++ pointers, or anyone interested in Linux customization. If you have any pointers or just want to share what you're working on, feel free to reach out!
