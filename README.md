👋 Hi, I’m @NoSleepBTW
Data Analyst by day | Curious Learner by night

I spend my work hours deep in Python, SQL, and Power BI, turning messy data into things that make sense for business. Lately, though, I’ve realized I want to understand more than just the "data" layer—I want to know how the machine actually works.

I’m definitely not a systems expert or a Linux pro yet. I’m currently in that "breaking things until I learn how to fix them" phase, and I'm loving every bit of it.
🛠️ What I'm Tinkering With

    Mission Control: This is my main project right now. It’s a set of scripts I’m writing to manage my Arch Linux/Hyprland environment. I’m trying to move away from pre-built frameworks like HyDE so I can learn to build my own "Mac-like" experience from scratch—even if I have to Google everything twice.

    Back to Basics: I’m teaching myself C++ using the C++ Primer. To keep myself honest, I’m doing this on a Raspberry Pi 5 with nothing but Neovim to force me to work with as little as possible.

    Data Work: On the professional side, I’m currently building a Revenue Operations & Fraud Detection dashboard using Streamlit and PostgreSQL.

📊 My Toolkit

    The "Pro" Stuff: Python (Pandas/Polars), SQL, Power BI, DAX, and Data Modeling.

    The "Learning" Stuff: Bash scripting (for Mission Control), C++, and low-level Linux customization.

🕹️ When the Screen Goes Dark

When I’m not debugging a volume script or an ELT pipeline, I’m usually:

    Running a campaign in Baldur's Gate 3.

    Getting lost in the UI of Metaphor: ReFantazio.

    Managing my home lab (a Pi-based NAS running Pi-hole and Docker).

🤝 Let's Connect!

If you’re a fellow data person, someone else struggling through their first C++ pointers, or just someone who thinks tiling window managers are cool, I’d love to chat. I’m always looking to learn from others and share the (many) mistakes I make along the way.
