# 👋 Hi, I’m @NoSleepBTW

### **About Me**

I am a professional **Data Analyst** by day, but a curious student of systems engineering by choice. My main goal for 2026 is to move beyond high-level data engineering and understand how computers actually work at a fundamental level. I am definitely not an expert yet—I am very much in the "learning by breaking things" phase.

---

### 📊 **Professional Toolkit**

* **Data Stack:** I work primarily with **Python**, **SQL**, and **Power BI**.
* **Expertise:** I specialize in data structures, algorithms, statistics, and turning messy datasets into business insights.
* **Current Project:** I'm currently refining a revenue operations and fraud detection dashboard using **Streamlit** and **PostgreSQL**.

### 🛠️ **Learning & Tinkering**

I am currently pushing myself to learn lower-level systems and "minimalist" development:

* **Project Mission Control:** I am building a custom, zero-dependency management system for my **Arch Linux** and **Hyprland** setup.
* **Current Progress:** The project is **60% complete**, with the core wallpaper and color systems operational.
* **C++ Foundations:** I am working through the *C++ Primer* to understand memory and logic.
* **Minimalist Environment:** To stay focused and force resource constraints, I am learning on a **Raspberry Pi 5** using only **Neovim**.
* **Home Lab:** I manage a home NAS on a Raspberry Pi, running services like **Pi-hole**, **Unbound**, and **Docker**.

### 🕹️ **Off-Duty Interests**

* **Gaming:** Currently running through **Baldur's Gate 3** and exploring the UI of **Metaphor: ReFantazio**.
* **Customization:** I enjoy tweaking my Linux environment to get a seamless, "Mac-like" feel.

### 🤝 **Let’s Connect**

I’m always looking to chat with fellow data folks, people learning C++, or anyone who enjoys tinkering with Linux. If you have pointers or just want to share what you’re learning, feel free to reach out!
